## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything crucial for my knowledge in HTML or CSS, but I sure made some mistakes along the way. There are inconsistencies in my code, and a lot of media query breakpoints that made my work look kind of messy.  I wish I had planned more on how the layout would change as it transition to mobile view for a cleaner code.

### Continued development

From here on, I'm going to start doing project that involves JS while expanding my knowledge in HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is where I go everytime I need reference.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - I picked up some tricks and ideas from the way he does CSS.
